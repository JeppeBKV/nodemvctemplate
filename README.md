# NodeMVCTemplate

To instantiate this template write "npx mvc-temp appName"

ERROR: if you have any spaces or - and so on in the filepath where you use the "npx mvc-temp appName" you will get an error. 
We are looking into it :)
So filepath should only be letters and numbers. ( That is what my limited test found out).

Here are and example of how the template works, you can delete the things in controllers, doc, models, public, routes, views and adjust app.js. 

This template for model view controllers using Node, express and MySQL.
app.js is server
routes folder is the routes of the website

controllers folder contains all functionality for each page

models folder contains models for your database connections

All of these folders come with examples of usage
 
We are currently working on adding middleware via passport.js
